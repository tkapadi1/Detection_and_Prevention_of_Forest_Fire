second install IDE Board - ESP8266 by going to file -> preferences -> under additional borad managers paste this -> https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json, http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json then click 'OK'

Third install the Libraries for DHT by going to tools -> manage libraries -> under filter your search type -> adafruit DHT sensor or download it using git file :-> https://github.com/adafruit/DHT-sensor-library

Fourth change the board from arduino uno to ESP8266 by going to tools -> boards -> NODEMCU 1.0(ESP-12E module)

fifth open the ide code given

sixth Compile the code using verify button (tick mark sign) and upload it to the Node-mcu using the upload button (->)

note: if the port shows error for uploading; in new terminal write : sudo chmod a+rw /dev/ttyUSB0 
	then try uploading again.

sixth run the python file provided in terminal - specifically for ubuntu. using command -> python "Filename".py
